# GDC Project 
1. Go through the entire tutorial and do the Part 1 and Part 2 with miRNA expression data for all
cancer types and do a multiclass classification. You can treat all the samples from normal tissues
from different cancer types as one single class.
2. In Part2, try a different model other than the one provided in the sample code.
3. Visualize the features after feature selection with t-SNE and PCA method [3]
4. Plot the evaluation metrics and ROC curve for the model.
